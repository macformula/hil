# Creating ECU Objects

Since our `Controller` will be frequently queried throughout a SIL test, its useful to wrap a `Controller` and a `BusManager` with a higher level struct, with methods that explicitly read and set I/O. These methods can be documented to clarify what specifically is being tested.
This abstraction encapsulates all of an ECU's input and output into a struct for easier lookup. Each test state will use this ECU object to test for certain conditions.
