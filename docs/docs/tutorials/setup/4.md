# SIL App

A SIL application contains a variety of high level structs that persist for the duration of a SIL test. 
Some of these structs need to access the properties and methods of other structs during a test. To make this interfacing easier, let's create a SIL struct to bundle our main application.

## SIL package

Create a file in the `sil` called `app.go`.

```go
package demoSil

import (
	"github.com/macformula/hil/canlink"
	"github.com/sil/ecu/democontroller"
	"github.com/sil/pinout"
)

// App represents the main application, it persists across multiple sequence runs.
type App struct {
	PinoutController      *pinout.Controller
	DemoControllerClient  *demoController.Client

	CurrProcess           *ProcessInfo
}
```

When we eventually implement `State`'s they will use this app struct to access the `Client` and `Controller` for the current test.
