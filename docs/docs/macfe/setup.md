# Developer Setup

Follow these steps to begin developing in `racecar/hil`.

## Dependencies

### Go
In order to compile and run Go code, you must download Go.

Go to [Go documentation](https://go.dev/doc/install) page and follow the installation guide.

To verify Go is installed correctly, run:

```bash
go version
```

### gRPC
You will need a Unix development environment (Unix machine, WSL, or remote into the Raspberry Pi).

Go through the [gRPC Go Quickstart Guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/). Build the example project.

As long as you can successfully build the gRPC example and have Go installed you are ready to get started with the SIL!
